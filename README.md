# hello-world
A repo I'm using to learn version control, github and git

This is my first commit, the changes I have made are the text that you see below.

So basically this is my first real foray into github using the hello-world tutorial.
I'm a self-taught(teaching) developer with a background in Electrical and Telecommunications engineering, at the time of writing this I was in my fifth and final year of my undergraduate studies.

Currently I am doing Andela's intermediate tutorial track for building a web application hence the need to learn git/github
By the end of the course I hpe to have learned as much python as possible and build projects/learn more about code, IT and 
computing in general

Thank you for reading this if you took the time.


Yours Sincerely,
